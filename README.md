# 🌾 Rainfall & Agricultural Yield Analytics using AWS, Snowflake & Power BI

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics pipeline** built using **AWS**, **Snowflake**, and **Power BI**. The goal is to analyze the impact of climate variables—**rainfall, temperature, and humidity**—on **crop yield** across various regions and timeframes.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Data Domain**: Agriculture & Climate
- **Technologies Used**:  
  - ☁️ **AWS** (Cloud Storage & Compute)  
  - 🧊 **Snowflake** (Cloud Data Warehousing)  
  - 📊 **Power BI** (Data Visualization)
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Rainfall Trends
  - Temperature Patterns
  - Humidity Levels
  - Crop-wise Yield Analysis
  - Region & Season-based Breakdown

---

## 📈 Key Insights & Dashboards

### 🌧 Rainfall Analysis
- **By Year**: Identifies yearly rainfall trends from 2000 to 2020.
- **By Season**: Insights into Rabi, Kharif, and Zaid season rainfall.
- **By Crop & Region**: How rainfall levels vary by specific crops and Indian locations.

### 🌡 Temperature Analysis
- Tracks average temperature over time and across:
  - Crops (e.g., Tea, Cashew, Ginger)
  - Seasons (Kharif, Rabi, Zaid)
  - Regions (Bangalore, Madikeri, Mysuru, etc.)

### 💧 Humidity Analysis
- Consistent tracking across years, crops, and geography.
- Used to understand moisture influence on crop growth.

### 🌾 Yield Analysis
- Visualized yield (in kilograms) for various crops:
  - High-yield crops: Cotton, Coconut, Ginger
  - Comparative yield across years, seasons, and locations
